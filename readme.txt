Description:
SimpleContactForm allows you receive contact messages from your users.
In the admin settings, you can specify:
1. Where the path of the contact page
2. If users are notified of their submissions, and if so, the reply address.
3. If admins are notified of user submissions, and if so, the forwarding
address.

In the theme files, you can specify, the thank you message.

SimpleContactForm depends on the ReCaptcha plugin to prevent spam.

2. Unzip the SimpleContactForm plugin and add it to your plugins directory.
3. Login as an admin, and go to Settings->Plugins.
4. Install the SimpleContactForm plugin.
